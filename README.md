# group6
This is our first group HTML project on APS

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to build a simple website using **pure HTML**. Each team member will work on a specific page of the site, ensuring it includes essential elements like tables, forms, and lists.

## Project Structure
- Each page must contain:
  - **A Table:** To organize data in a structured format.
  - **A Form:** To collect user input.
  - **A List:** To display a collection of related items.
  - ** and other things you learned and need to uesed
 
  - ## Branching Strategy
Each team member will:
1. Create a **separate branch** to work on their specific page.
   - **Branch Naming Convention:** Use your name or page purpose.  
     Example: `ghazaal-contact-page`, `maryam-about-us`.
2. Make all changes and commits on their own branch.
3. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** when their page is ready for review.
4. Resolve any conflicts or feedback before merging into the main branch.
